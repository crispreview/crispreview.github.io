Beer and crisps are a fantastic combination. A core part of the British experience. A transcendental combination much greater than the sum of their parts. 

Then there's these. 

They're not bad. But they're not very good either. There's something about Aldi crisps that makes me think of fish and chips. I think it's the grease. 

Upon opening the packet there's the slightest smell of beer but it doesn't deliver on the tastebuds. Crunch. Salt and a little sweetness. Nothing. Then a small taste of beer, almost like a beery burp. Or the taste in your mouth after a long night on the booze. A distant memory of something enjoyable. 

It didn't stop me eating the whole bag.

5/10 

They came highly recommended but left me wanting. I'd say you should try them for yourself but you can't. They're gone. A distant beery memory.

Up next, something spicy.
