Doritos are good crisps. Chilli Heatwave Doritos are very good crisps. Extra Flamin' Hot Doritos are extra very good crisps. I just wish they'd spelt Flaming properly.

Spicy crisps are often tomato flavour crisps with some extra flavours. These aren't. That is a good thing. These are a very savoury crisp. There's a hint of marmite, or something equally umami, combined with a 'chilli powder' flavour and a slowly building heat. They're not massively spicy but they are certainly spicier than the regular Chilli Heatwave Doritos. 

I forgot to take a picture of the acual crisps. They're startling. They're thickly coated with a reddish orange dust that gets all over your fingers. It's the kind of flavouring that gets on your clothes if you're not careful. 

Walker's have also made Extra Flamin' Hot Crunchy Wotsits and Extra Flamin' Hot Max crisps. They're nice enough, but there's something about Doritos that is a perfect match for this flavour. The slight sweetness of the corn chip adds an extra dimension of deliciousness.

9/10 

These crisps come with a strong reccomendation. They're pretty delicious. And it's nice to write a properly positive review for once.

Up next, something a little more classic.
