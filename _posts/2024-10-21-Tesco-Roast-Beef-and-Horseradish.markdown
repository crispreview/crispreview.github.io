I am suspicious of supermarket branded crisps. I don't know why. Aldi's beer crisps didn't help. These ones, however, have turned that all around.

These crisps are excellent. They are savoury. The horseradish is, horseradishy. The crinkle cut is almost perfect and they're loaded with flavour. I am very impressed. 

The horseradish is the star of the show here. It's pungent but not offensivley strong. There's a hint of mustard as well, which is delicious. Then there's a nice strong, savoury, meaty flavour. Beef, I guess. I could go on but I don't want labour the point too much. I like these crisps. A lot.

I normally finish a bag of crisps in one sitting. These, however, left me satisfied after just a few handfuls.

A powerful, powerful crisp. I will be seeing what else Tesco have got on offer.

Up next, something crunchy.
