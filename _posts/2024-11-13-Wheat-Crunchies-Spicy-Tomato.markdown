It's time for another trip down memory lane. It's 12:15 and I've got sandwiches made with cheap white bread, a bag of Wheat Crunchies and a slightly melted Penguin. Then I'm going to run around for a bit and pretend to shoot my friends. Excellent.

Let's address the elephant in the room. Â£1.25 for a bag of crisps is too much. I know it's a big bag but it's too much.

As for the crisps; they're great. I haven't had Wheat Crunchies in a very long time and I'm glad I picked them up. The flavouring is really good. There's lots of tangy tomato but no discernable spice. That's okay. I find that 'spicy' crisps generally means 'tomato' anyway so this wasn't a surprise. There's also a slight sweetness lingering in the background. I think the sweetness comes from the wheat. Normally I don't want sweetness in my crisps but it complements the tomato pretty well. 

They're also really crunchy. It would be annoying if they weren't. If they were called 'Wheat Crunchies' and were chewy then I don't think this review would be anywhere near as positive.

I'm not sure there's much else to say here. They're a solid crisp.

A great walking about crisp.

Up next, something else.
