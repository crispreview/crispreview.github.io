I bought these Chipsticks for purely nostalgic reasons. They are a 'corner-shop' crisp. You're not going to get them in your packed lunch. Instead, you're going to walk home and spend your bus money on a bag of these and a curly wurly.

I spent quite a long time on the Smith's Wikipedia page before writing this. I'm not going to regurgitate the information because you're capable of reading. However, I was surprised to learn that Smith's invented Salt and Vinegar. 

Chipsticks are Salt and Vinegar flavour. Not all Salt and Vinegar crisps are equal and fortunatley these are good ones. They taste of cheap chip shop vinegar rather than poncy balsamic or apple cider vinegar. I think it's the same flavour they use on Squares. These crunchy little sticks are an absolute delight. 

They're not 'crisps' in the traditional sense. Instead they're sort of puffed little sticks that disolve in your mouth and get stuck in your teeth and give you the slightest hearburn because of the vinegar. They're absolutely delicious.

I just find the wierd long bag a little off putting.

They're an excellent crisp. What else is there to say?

Up next, something more nuanced.
