Like Hull before it, another northern city with a poor reputation is the City of Culture. And how are we celebrating Bradford's year in the spotlight? With a bag of crisps, of course!

<!--excerpt-->

Seabrook and Morrisons have worked together to create 3 flavours of crisps inspired by Bradford's culture. Today, I bring you a review of their Fish and Chip flavoured offering. 

These are less 'wavy' and more 'ridged' than the normal Seabrook crisp. The texture is fantastic. They are crisp, crunchy, and a total delight to chew.

It's a shame the flavour lets them down. When I think of Fish and Chips, I think of salt and vinegar. Unfortunately, there's no vinegar to be found here. Instead, there's a faintly fishy flavour and a hint of the strange yeastiness that was used in the disastrous [Aunt Bessie's roast potato flavour crisps](https://www.crispreview.co.uk/2023/12/23/seabrooks-x-aunt-bessies-roast-potato-and-black-pepper.html). They're not unpleasant, but they're not amazing.

I was expecting salt and vinegar and was severely disappointed. There's no mention of salt and vinegar anywhere on the packet and I know some people who don't put vinegar on their fish and chips so the disappointment is probably all my fault.

Excellent texture, disappointing flavour.

Up next, more Seabrooks.
