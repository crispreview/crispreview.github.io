Britain's fifth biggest supermarket made some spicy crisps and I ate them. Now I am going to tell you what I thought about them. 

<!--excerpt-->

These crisps are ridged. They're nice and thick. They're well coated with flavouring and there are little green flecks of herbs on them. They look pretty promising.

And man, what a crunch. They're a bit greasy but that's okay. They're some of the crispiest crisps I've eaten in a while.

They are seasoned with a good mix of herbs and spices but the star anise is pretty heavy handed. There's tomato because all chilli flavoured crisps taste of tomato. It's the law. The Scotch Bonnet is also apparent, with a slight fruitiness and some heat. 

The rest of the herbs and spices are a little muddled but the crisps are nice and savoury. However, I think they should have leant into the fruitness of the Scotch Bonnet some more. A bit of mango, or pineapple, would have gone  a long way.

Excellent texture, decent flavour. There's not much more to say.

Up next, something Spanish.
