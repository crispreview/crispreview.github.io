¿Hablas español? No! But that's not going to stop me. It's international week at CrispReview.

Do you like the subtle and nuanced flavours of salt and MSG? If so, you are going to absolutley love Grefusa - ¡Boom! Tijuana.

These 'crisps' are made of corn, reconstituted into unholy crunchy spheres, and covered in an orange coloured powder that gets everywhere. The primary flavours are those of salt and MSG, with a slight sweetness and a hint of garlic. There is a subtle, building heat and an underlying fruitiness.

They make for a pretty pleasant snack, unlike anything I've eaten before.

Should you travel to Spain to buy them? Probably not. But they're worth a shot if you spot them.

Sabor que te explota en la boca como una bomba de intensidad indeed.

Up next, more foreign muck.
