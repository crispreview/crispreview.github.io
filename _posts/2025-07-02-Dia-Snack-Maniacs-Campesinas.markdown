Today, I continue exploring the Iberian Peninsula through the medium of crisps.

These papas come courtesy of Dia, Spain's "multinational discount supermarket chain". A real oasis of airconditioned calm in the 37 degree heat.

According to my expert translation skills, 'Campesinas' translates to Peasant, Rural, or (some what less likely) Farmer's Wife. Whatever it means, they're delicious. If this is what they eat in the Spanish countryside, I'm applying for a visa, buying a farm, and finding a wife.

These crisps have the skin on, which is a rare treat. They are perfectly crunchy and seasoned with just the right amount of flavouring. Tomato, onion, garlic, sin gluten. What's not to like?

It turns out padding out the word count whilst reviewing delicious crisps is a challenge.

Another solid snack.

Up next, something transcendental.
