Cheese and onion, salt and vinegar, curry and... barbecue?

I really don't know where to start with this one.

Let's start with the facts...

- They look like a bit like chipsticks. 
- They smell faintly of curry. 
- They are crunchy yet chewy. 
- They're orange. 
- They taste of wet cardboard.

I ate two handfuls and threw the rest away.
