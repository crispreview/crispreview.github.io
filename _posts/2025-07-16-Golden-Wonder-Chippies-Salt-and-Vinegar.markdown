Hello heartburn, my old friend.

Now these are an unusual crisp. They're like shoestring fries that have been cut into tiny, short, pieces. It's almost like a bag full of ridges which have been separated from each other. Some have skin on, some do not. I do not know what manafacturing error led to this creation but I'm glad it happened.

The 'crisps' are very crunchy. Because they are small you have to grab unsightly handfuls and shovel them into your mouth. Or you can pour them straight in from the bag. Whatever you choose, it's undignified in the best way.

As for flavour... It's more of a feeling than a flavour. These are the most powerful salt and vinegar crisps I have ever eaten. They are mouth numbing. I could almost feel my lips going blue. The acidity makes its way down your gullet and sits heavily in your stomach.

They are fantastic.

When I ask for "lots" of sdalt and vinegar at the chip shop, this is what I mean.

Up next, something more nuanced.
