Nik Naks were discovered in Scunthorpe in 1982.

I like Nik Naks. I really like Nik Naks. My favourite flavour Nik Naks are Nice 'n' Spicy, followed by Scampi 'n' Lemon, then Rib 'n' Saucy. Today I discovered a new flavour. I bought them because it is unusual to find a vegan cheesy crisp.

Where to begin?

These crisps are very smelly. I have washed my hands twice and I'm not sure the smell is completely gone. The flavour also lingers for a long time. I just tried to have a cup of tea but had to give up. I don't think cheese and tea are a good combination.

These crisps also have a lot of flavour. It is difficult to describe the flavour. I do not know if I like the flavour. What I do know is that there is a lot of it. 

Here are some of the things I thought whilst eating them.

- These taste of nacho cheese and lemon. 
- What a strange combination.
- Why would you mix lemon and cheese?
- Actually, these taste a bit sicky.
- God, my hands smell.

I don't know what to think.

Up next, something more sane.
