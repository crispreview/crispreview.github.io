I could see from the packet that these were not going to be normal Hula Hoops and I was right. It is nice to be right.

It took me an embarasingly long time to get the pun on the front. To be honest, I'm not 100% sure I get it. F-lava-rings? F-lav-ar-ings? Flav-a-rings? Flavourings? Flavour Rings?

Whatever they're called, they're "Big, Bold and Soo... Irresitible" which left me with no choice. I had to buy them.

I'm glad I bout them but they're not Hula Hoops. They're, big, round Monster Munch. If these are Hula Hoops, then so are Onion Rings. And if Onion Rings are Hula Hoops, so are Calamari. We have to draw a line somewhere.

They don't taste like Calamari though. They taste like spicy flavour. There's no tomato in the ingredients but the taste of tomato is there. I think it's the mix of citric acid, sugar, and savoury flavourings. There's cumin, too, which is nice. They're also slightly greasy. It's a nice kind of greasy.

I really liked these.

Up next, a classic.
