"Roysters are the UK’s only, original, American-style bubble chips!" 

<!--excerpt-->

In 1992 KP Snacks pulled the wool over everyone's eyes. They told us that the Americans ate "Bubble Chips". It was 1992, so no one could check. America was too far away. They had MTV and Hot Topic. They had Sir Mix-a-Lot. Were bubble chips so unbelievable? 

KP Snacks told us a lie and we swallowed it wholesale. I'm glad we did. These are a great crisp. The texture is fantastic. It's unlike anything else. The crisps have bubbles on them. They're crunchy but collapse into a chewy pulp. The T-Bone Steak flavour is a standard meaty flavour but it has a good level of salt 

They're very moreish.

Reconsituted potato snacks are great.
