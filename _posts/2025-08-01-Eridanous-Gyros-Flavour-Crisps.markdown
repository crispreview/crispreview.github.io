Είναι εβδομάδα ελληνικής κουζίνας στα Lidl και τρώω πατατάκια.

_Gyros is meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie, then sliced and served wrapped or stuffed in pita bread, along with other ingredients such as tomato, onion, fried potatoes, and tzatziki._ - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyros)


These are crisps not gyros.

They are very crunchy and very salty. Those are good qualities in a crisp. They taste of thyme, or oregano. It is a nice flavour. They don't really taste of meat. Instead, they taste of the herbs you would associate with meat. A bit like those roast chicken flavour crisps that don't contain any chicken but just taste a bit like sage and onion.

They are also surprisingly orange. I like it when crisp flavouring has a colour.

Other than that, there is little to report. They were a nice snack but I will not be sad when Greek week is over.

Not bad.

Up next, a pink packet.
