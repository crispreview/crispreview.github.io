These are very, very good.

Theres a hint of Lynx Africa about the packaging. It's probably best not to think about Prawn Cocktail flavoured body spray. I hadn't really made the connection before. I think all the Max crisps look like this. I guess they're crisps for blokes. Blokes who want to smell like teenagers.

Some people say that Prawn Cocktail crisps taste like ketchup. Those people are wrong. [I do not like ketchup.](https://www.crispreview.co.uk/2025/06/18/Walkers-Tomato-Ketchup.html). I do like Prawn Cocktail. They taste different and I will not listen to anyone who says otherwise.

These Prawn Cocktail crisps are special. Tangy yet sweet with that signature fishy undertone (achieved through purely vegan means). They are also spicy. It's a tangy, acidic, pokey kind of spice. There's no building heat. No lingering regret. Just a nice spicy tickle on the tip of the tounge.

Like all 'Max' crisps, these crisps are ridged and crunchy.

Fantastic.

I also think 70g is the optimum packet size.

Up next, something I should have reviewed a long time ago.
