<p>They’re the standard McCoy’s crisp. They’re ridged with a good crunch. They’ve got a liberal sprinkling of flavour. They taste pretty nice. And they do that thing where they leave some flavouring behind on your fingers and then you lick it off and then you can’t decide whether it’s great or whether you hate yourself.</p>

<p>A slightly spicy, tomato foward flavour with a good level of acidity. The acidity probably come from the apple juice powder. I don’t think I’ve ever had crisps with apple juice as an ingredient before.</p>

<p>Pretty good. A possible contender for the meal deal crisp of choice?</p>

<p>8/10</p>

<p>Another Seabrooks offering today. This time, one from their ‘collaboration’ with Aunt Bessie’s. Aunt Bessie’s have also made some beer with Northern Monk. I’m not sure what they’re up to but I don’t like it. Stick with the frozen yorkshires and roast potatoes. You’re not doing anyone any favours with this nonsense.</p>

<p>When I picked up the crisps I thought, “These will be nice.” I was wrong. These are disgusting.</p>

<p>They could have taken the standard Seabrook, added some black pepper, and been done with it. After all, crisps already taste of potato. Instead they’ve added some garlic powder, rosemary and yeast extract. I really wish they hadn’t.</p>

<p>Oddly cheesy with a lingering aftertaste. Unpleasantly greasy. Best avoided. A bit like the beer they made.</p>

<p>1/10</p>

<p>Up next, something less disgusting.</p>]]></content><author><name>Crisp Review</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seabrook x Aunt Bessie’s - Roast Potato &amp; Black Pepper Another Seabrooks offering today.

<p>Lets ease back into this with something simple. A real classic of the genre. Seabrook are the master of ridged crisps. They’ve cracked the formula. Wavy and crisp with just the right amount of bite. If you’re looking for a lunch box crisp, you could do worse than this. They’re not a show-piece and no one will thank you for bringing a bag around to a dinner party but sometimes that’s not what you’re after.</p>

<p>They’ve got the perfect amount of salt. Just right for cutting through the grease of a toastie. A perfect pairing. They’re also excellent in a crisp sandwich. Two slices of cheap white bread and plenty of vegetable oil based spread. Pack the crisps in and give the sandwich a good firm squash. A real tonic for the troubled times we find outselves in.</p>

<p>A solid 8/10.</p>
